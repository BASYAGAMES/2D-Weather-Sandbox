- [x] Improve surface visualization
- [x] Add tree / vegetation textures
- [x] Make dust blow up in dry areas
- [x] Make fire spread and burn out, only in areas with vegetation
- [x] Improve fire visualization
- [x] Fix slope(green triangle) being lit up by fire
- [x] Snowy trees
- [x] Fix sounding aspect ratio
- [x] Extend sounding scale to 50Â°C
- [X] Add wind tool: move air by dragging

Newest Release:
- [x] Improve Lake/Sea editing
- [x] Improve sky visuals
- [x] Improve surface visuals
- [x] Make vertical resolution configurable from 100 to 300 cells
- [x] don't show grass underwater
- [x] Fix snow landing underwater bug
- [x] Fix fire buring on water bug
- [x] Improve fire spreading system
- [x] Fix snow albedo
- [.] Improve Lake/Sea depth visualization
- [.] Scale tree height with vertical resolution
- [ ] Improve precipitation spawning system and fix related bugs
- [ ] Make behaviour of IR radiation and precipitation scale with vertical resolution to fix different behavior

Next Release:
- [ ] Make soil and vegitation color change with soil moisture
- [ ] Add realistic albedo's for defferent surface types
- [ ] Add dynamic vegetation option. Vegetation will grow when soil is wet, and die if to dry
- [ ] Add weather stations with current conditions

Future:
- [ ] Make weather stations show history in plots
- [ ] Add lightning effect
- [ ] Add plane flying mode. You will be able to fly a realistic plane trough the clouds at realistic scale and speed
- [ ] Add forces to simulate coriolis effect and pressure systems to make weather more dynamic
